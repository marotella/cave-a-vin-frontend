# Design:
CSS was used to design the project, along with flexbox and Bootstrap. 
All pages have the same header and footer to allow for ease of navigation.
Text animation was included along with the ability to enlarge images.
Media Query was used to create a more responsive design.

# Next Steps:
Create a search feature to filter the index page for a user based on the wine name.
User authentication to allow for favoriting wines and controlling access to delete and update.
